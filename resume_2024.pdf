SUMMARY


I have had a career spanning corporate finance and executive assistant, customer service, retail, IT and most recently software development. I mentor others through 1:1’s or the Austin Community College and founded Pflugerville Gays with my colleague. I speak about neurodiversity, I lead by example. I seek to educate and to continuously learn and grow as a person.
I want to work towards being a fixture in my community, to work for the people. I am driven by breaking the glass ceiling and bringing resources and dignity to the vulnerable in my community. I come highly recommended, and I pride myself on my skill and personable nature. Please do not hesitate to reach out.
